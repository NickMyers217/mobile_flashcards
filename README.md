# Mobile Flashcards
This is a simple react-native app that allows users to create various groups of flash cards, and study them!

It was created for the final assessment project of Udacity's React Native course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

## Prequisites
This react native app has only been developed and tested to work with Android 5.0 at the moment, as I do not have access to an IOS device or emulator.

You will need the ability to run this app on either an Android emulator, or an Anroid device.

## Installation and Setup
The following shell commands will clone and run the project locally.

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nickmyers217/mobile_flashcards
cd mobile_flashcards
yarn install # or npm install
yarn start # or npm start
```
The app should now be running, so follow the on screen instructions to load the app into your emulator or on your phone using expo!
